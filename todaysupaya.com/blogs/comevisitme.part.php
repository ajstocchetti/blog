<p>I want you to come visit me. i'm going to be at Panya for the month of August, and i want you to come. i want you to see me in one of my favorite places on earth. i want you to see how happy i am at one of my favorite places on earth. i want you to see me shine with joy and delight like a child, going through the every day tasks. i wish i could do it all the time, but for right now i need you to come to Thailand to see me at my best.</p>
<p>i want you to come to Panya. i fear for the fate of the planet. ive stayed up late worrying about co2 levels and gmos and global consciousness. and i think every day about how to create changes in society to address these issues. i want you to come to Panya, because Panya is doing it right. it's not perfect, but damn are they trying hard, and doing a great job. maybe they're not the only possible solution, but they're a source of inspiration for me. i think if you saw Panya you would also believe that great things are possible.</p>
<p>but mostly i want to hang out with you when i'm in my zone.</p>
