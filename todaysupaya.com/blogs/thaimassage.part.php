<p>So, I haven't posted in a while. I guess I haven't had much to say. The first internship ended three weeks ago. I had three lazy days at Panya before I had to leave. The International School of Bangkok has a 'week without walls', where the students chose to go on one of a number of outdoor adventures; including safaris in Africa, skiing in Europe, and a week at Panya. For this week, everybody who was not a manager or long-term volunteer was asked to leave. I spent it in Chiang Mai, relaxing. I read three books, watched two seasons of Breaking Bad, and ate a kilogram of dried mango. I don't have much to say about the week other than it was relaxing. I'm still mulling over the content of the books, hopefully I post something about them at a later date.</p>
<p>One of the wonderful things to do in Thailand is get a Thai massage. For 150 baht (about $5.50) you can get a one hour massage. The massage usually consists of a little Asian woman contorting your body in all sorts of absurd positions and laughing when it hurts. Today, I was lying on my stomach, and the masseuse grabbed part of my upper triceps. I yelped, jumped a bit, and started flailing my leg (anybody who has massaged a tender part of my body knows what I mean when I flail my legs/feet when in pain). Instead of stopping, she laughed, pulled back the curtain and showed her friend massaging the guy in the next stall over how much pain I was in. Also, in every single massage I've gotten, when I roll over onto my back, they all make some comment about my chest hair (well, most of them can't speak any English, so they say something in Thai and gently tug on the hair that's sticking out of my shirt). But hey, I feel great afterwards.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a German intern at Panya named Pascal. Pascal loves to talk about this commercial "back home." It starts off with two Germans sitting in a U-boat when lights start flashing and sirens go off. They pick of the phone and cry out "We're sinking! We're sinking!" The person on the other end of the phone replies with "Hello, this is the German coast guard. Vat are you sinking about?" (The commercial is for an English-language course.)</p>
