<p>In Chiang Mai, you can buy clean, potable water on the street. Every couple of blocks, there are stations where you insert a coin and can fill up your water bottle. I'm glad that the city (or it could be a national initiative) is promoting clean water. But I've only seen tourists use these, so maybe they were up so tourists don't complain about drinking water. Regardless, it is nice that there are outlets to refill a container, instead of buying a new water bottle every time.

<p>I have been told that there are at least three avocado trees currently bearing fruit at Panya. So it goes.</p>

<p>It's not that the distance has changed, it is the immediacy and availability. When I was in the US, I was always available. You could pick up a phone and call me at any time. Or you could email me and I would get it within a number of hours. And even if we didn't live in the same city, there was a chance I could come by. Now that I'm overseas, all of that has changed. Communication is less reliable, and the time of response jumps. And that chance of a visit is no more. That's what has changed.
