<p>One thing about Panya is that we have solar hot water here. That means we heat our water in the sun. No big heater in the basement, nothing burned, just good old natural sunlight. While this is great and low-energy, it's not the best system. Panya's solar heater is very inefficient. And with 40 people on site right now (thanks to the internship), the warm water we do have runs out fast.</p>
<p>Nick and Greg, two of the long-term volunteers, were fed up with this and decided to take matters into their own hands. They made a compost water heater. They made a compost pile (out of elephant dung and rice husk) and coiled about 300 feet of hose through it. The compost pile itself is roughly 1 cubic meter. This compost heated the water to 150&deg Fahrenheit. And it was so plentiful that they asked us to use the shower to cool of the compost pile (if the compost gets too hot, it will burn out too soon and will not fully break down the input materials). It is amazing! 150&deg water for three days. The water has now cooled off to about 100&deg. I can live with that. Now I don't have to mix it with cold water.</p>
<p>I once heard of a guy who does this on a larger scale. He takes an old pool, runs pipe through it, then fills it with woodchips. As the woodchips decompose, they heat his house. One system heats his house for over a year (granted it takes about seven trees to fill, but it still lasts quite a while). So if this works on such a large scale (a pool heating a house for a year), and on a small scale (a small compost heating water for a month), why don't we use it more often? It's way cheaper and more efficient than conventional heating, and the compost at the end can be added to gardens or whatnot to improve soil quality. It's a win/win!
