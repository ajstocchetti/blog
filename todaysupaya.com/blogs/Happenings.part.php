<p>Today I had to put out fires. Unfortunately, not in the metaphorical sense. One of the farmers that neighbors Panya started their field on fire, to clear it. Unfortunately, the fire got a bit out of control and was threatening to spread onto Panya's land. There is a fire break here at Panya, but it gets overgrown during the wet season. Just this morning, one of the long term volunteers said that one of Monday's tasks was to clear out the fire break. Well, not soon enough. I was impressed with how well everybody handled it. At one point during the afternoon work session Nick came down from the food forest and said that there was a fire coming. We all grabbed hoes and shovels and machetes and went up to the hill. Once we got there, we assessed the fire. All of us started clearing a fire break, and after a while we lit a back fire on the "away" side of the fire break. Nobody argued, or panicked. Everybody did their job without knowing what their job was. All for the good of the community. It was nice.</p>

<p>Other than that, I've been doing de-construction lately. We're tearing down the old Sala now so that we can re-build it during the workshops (first one starts on Monday). Earlier in the week I was tearing down posts and beams and ripping up floorboards. I thought that was rough. For the last 2 days, I've had to take down a wall of adobe bricks, one by one. We're saving the bricks to re-use in the next sala. It feels like an archeological dig out there. And, because we've already torn down the roof, we're in direct sun. It's tough work, but all in all I don't mind it. To be honest, I'm into construction much more than de-construction.

<p>I hope you all find this next part as funny as I do. There is a man named Alan helping out at Panya. Alan is French. He currently works in Chiang Mai for an NGO that does something in Burma (I think they provide some type of education). Like all of us at Panya, Alan has a separate set of clothes that he wears for working. Alan's work shirt is a brown t-shirt with a picture of a mobile home, and has the caption "Home sweet home: Akron, Ohio." I'm not sure why, but I think that shirt is hilarious. Mostly because Alan has never heard of Akron Ohio, has no clue where it is, and probably wouldn't care either. I wonder how he came across the shirt.
