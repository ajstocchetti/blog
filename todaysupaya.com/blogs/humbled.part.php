<p>Without realizing it, I came to India with an inflated ego. I came here, on a mission to build public toilets for a rural village. I knew that it would be difficult, but I was relying on my 'advanced knowledge' of people and culture to navigate the difficulties. I thought I was so smart, and so well travelled; and that my experiences would carry me through. I thought I was the shit. I know I was the shit.
</p><p>
Tonight I was knocked off my pedestal (and it's about time). We were having a meeting about changing our timeline based on comments from the village. The Americans in the group were going on and on about why we are doing things a certain way. Then Prabin, a Humanure Power team member that lives in Bihar, spoke up. He explained to us how this was part of Indian culture, then explained how to get around it.

Mind blown.

I thought I was so smart. I thought I knew so much, that I could understand these people in-and-out. What I didn't realize was that I didn't expect these people to understand me. I assumed that with my background, education, and experience (and whatever other privileges of being a white upper-middle class male gave me), I was better informed and more capable to deal with other cultures than they are to deal with me. And that whole theory was thrown in my face when Prabin not only explained to us that we were dealing with a different culture we didn’t understand, but settled the argument by saying so.

It was humbling. It put me in my place. But amazes me is that I was holding a belief without realizing I was holding it. And it was incredibly arrogant. The part that gets to me is that I thought because I went to college in the US and have all these worldly experiences, <i>other</i> people weren't as smart. That somehow, because of what I've been through, somebody else is lowered. I don't know what they have been through. Who am I to judge somebody else's intelligence?</p>
