<p>I feel like I just turned my back on a whole community. When I think about Madison, most of my memories are of ultimate, especially the latter ones. Ultimate was one of the best things I had going for me out there. Yes, it was great because it kept me active. But it was more than that. It was a community of people! There was always something going on. I could go to the Dane at least twice a week and be with friends. There was the camaraderie after practices/tournaments. And there was an openness, a friendliness, an easy acceptance. Or at least that’s how I chose to remember it.</p>
<p>But I walked away. I didn't walk away from ultimate, I walked away from Madison. Not because I didn't like the people – I loved them. But ultimately, Madison wasn't pushing me to grow in the direction I wanted to grow. So I moved to New York.</p>
<p>I’m definitely feeling the lack of community here. Yeah, I've got friends here. But they’re all busy. And I’m not. And that makes for an Andy with too much time on his hands. I’m not gonna lie, it’s been tough.</p>
<p>What I find so interesting is how, for as much as I love community, I know very little about how to build one from scratch. It was easy in college – my community became the ultimate team (specifically those who lived on the hill freshman year, but eventually the whole program). In Madison, I had my Epic starting class. We were all in the same boat, and naturally stuck together for mutual benefit. And then I was adopted into the ultimate community. So I had two great communities to bounce between. But here: not so much. Granted, my exposure with the NY ultimate community has been low, but it’s drastically different from Madison. Or maybe I just don’t remember being on the outside. At least when I was new in Madison I had knew Rob, and there were plenty of Epic implants I could relate to.</p></div>
