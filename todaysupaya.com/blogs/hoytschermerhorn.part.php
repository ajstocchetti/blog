<p>Joe and I were siting next to each other on the G train. "Next stop is Hoyt-Schermerhorn" announces the conductor over the PA.
</p><p>Joe taps me on the shoulder. "Thats us."
</p><p>I think about it for a brief moment. "Which one am I?"
</p><p>"Your Hoyt, I'm Schermerhorn" he replies immediately, as of he were expecting the question.
</p><p>I smile to myself as the two of us stand and exit the train.</p></div>
