<br />

I am lying on my couch reading a collection of short stories by F Scott Fitzgerald. The album <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/recsradio/radio/B0000029H8/ref=pd_krex_dp_001_001?ie=UTF8&track=001&disc=001">French Cuisine</a> is playing in the background. I have a glass of Merlot sitting next to me. I look up from my book to see my coffee table littered with books and a pamphlet for the Madison botanical gardens. Beyond that is my bike and tool box. In the corner stands a bookcase full of books. <i>My life might not be perfect</i>, I think to myself, <i>but I sure am on the right track.</i>
