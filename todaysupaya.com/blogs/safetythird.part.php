<p>I'm always amazed at construction in Asia. We paid some villagers to come and weld the roof trusses together this week. They were climbing on shaky scaffolding and across trusses that were held in by nothing but gravity. They had some 14 gauge wire taped into an extension cord to power their welder. Back when I was working on the bamboo house in India, we were doing similar things, but at on a much smaller scale. We would climb up our bamboo structure and tie joists and beams together with rope, while hanging on with our legs. And barefoot, of course - you get better traction with the bottom of your feet than with shoes. Construction work barefoot...or in flip flops, that’s how it goes. In India, we came up with an expression on the worksite: Safety...third? That's how I felt watching the welder work this week.</p>
<p>Speaking of safety (or the lack there of), I found out this week that the 3rd prong on plugs in Thailand serves no electrical function. It is NOT a grounding prong. The prong is so that it grips the outlet better. You can rip it out of the plug. It's not attached to anything electrical within the device. Isn't that a nice feeling?</p>
<p>We were trying to give a demo at the Sala earlier this week. One of the welders turned on their metal saw to cut something (it's like an angle grinder saw blade, but 14" in diameter). They were really going at it, and the saw is really loud, so we had to wait for them to finish. After about thirty seconds of this, I walked over to see what was going on. The guy was sharpening his pencil. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>And one last note. I was in Chaing Mai this weekend. Walking past the myriad massage shops, one had a sign hanging from their window that read "Massage only, no sex." Fantastic.</p>
