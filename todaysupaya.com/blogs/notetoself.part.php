<p>So, y'all remember when I skipped out on senior week at CMU to be a youth delegate to the UN Conference on Sustainable Development back in 2009? Well, after a week of UN sessions, meeting with policymakers, challenging and inspiring conversations with other students, and my own international affairs, the Sustain US youth caucus was ready for a drink. Somebody recommended a bar in the west village, and, not knowing anything about the city, I followed the group.</p>
<p>The bar was a club in a basement. I wasn't impressed and I forgot about the place soon thereafter. Until tonight. Graduation from my Envirolution course was this evening, and it was held at the Fat Cat Jazz Club. As I strolled into the club, it seemed familiar. I vaguely remembered that long blue stairwell down to the bouncer. Then once I got in and looked at the place, I realized I had been there before. It was the same club from four years ago. That's a crazy coincidence, but I've been having a bunch of those lately. Randomly running into Joe on the subway, McSorely's pub, etc. I should think about what it means when I have some free time.</p>
