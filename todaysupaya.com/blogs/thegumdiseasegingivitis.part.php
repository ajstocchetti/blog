I was getting my teeth cleaned the other day, and my dentist kept talking about the gum disease gingivitis. And she always referred to it as "the gum disease gingivitis", which seemed excessive to me. What an elaborate name to keep saying - <i>the gum disease gingivitis</i>. Are there other forms of gingivitis, but she was referring to the one that attacks the gums? Did she think I don't know what gingivitis is, so she called out that it is a gum disease? (Obviously gingivitis is an inflammation of the gingiv.) Did she think that if she used the term disease I would be more scared and take her seriously? It was so much work on her part. It was like when Prince changed his name to a symbol, and was called "the artist formerly known as Prince." Eventually, people got sick of it and he went back to Prince. Why not call it gingivitis, and save us all some time?
