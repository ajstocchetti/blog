<!-- Title: butter cream --><!-- Location: Panya --><!-- Date: 26 July 2013 --><div class="post">26 July 2013 <br />Panya <div class="title">butter cream</div><br /><p>I've been doing well since I arrived at Panya last week. I must admit, I felt like I was coming to Panya from India with my tail between my legs. I still feel that I was not being useful in Bihar and staying there was not in my best interest. I came to Panya to fill the six weeks between leaving Bihar and going to NYC. I wish that I had more focus for this time (in relation to my long term life goals); but I'm confidant Panya was one of my better options, all things considered. I've come to accept this as just another step in my life - another lesson to learn.</p><p>Like I said, I've been doing well at Panya. Currently, I'm support staff for a one week Intro to Permaculture class. I do all sorts of behind the scenes work: making breakfast and lunch (we make the students cook dinner for the community, with guidance from the teachers), preparing tools and materials for the hands-on sessions, doing general maintenance, and anything else that is needed. Yesterday one of the steps to the men's dorm broke - I eagerly dug through the workshop looking for a replacement and fixed it. It felt good to do construction again.</p><p>We bought milk today. Forty liters of it. Fresh from the cow. We set aside three liters for drinking, then boiled the rest. As the milk heats up, the cream will rise to the top. We pulled off this cream and will use it to make butter tomorrow (it needs to sit out for twelve hours). I'm super excited for that. After the cream is pulled off, you are left with skim milk. Half of it we will use to make yogurt (by adding a yogurt culture and letting it sit). The other half we turned to cheese by adding vinegar (any acidic substance will work - I hear lime juice adds great flavor, but you need a lot of lime juice). Days like today make me regret not following through on two ideas I've had for years now. The first is to live without purchasing any value-added product. No jams, no butter, no tomato sauce, no clothes. Only buying fruit, sugar, milk, cloth, etc. Okay, so I probably would buy some value added products, especially electronics, but I think it would an awesome way to live. Making all my food from scratch - everything would have so much more flavor, so much more meaning. My other idea is to live with the Amish for a year or so. I think that would be so cool. One would learn so much! I would learn about timber construction techniques, using livestock for agriculture, all sorts of cooking methods. The two ideas are very closely linked, but I also think it would be fun to try to live without value added products in a modern setting.</p><p>Anyway, so after the milk was brought to a boil, it needed to sit out to cool before we could make cheese/yogurt. This was appropriately timed to be during the afternoon session. Not being a student, I was not at the afternoon session, and was free to roam about. I happened to end up in the kitchen and noticed the two pots of warm milk sitting out. First, I started poking the skin with a fork, just because. When I stopped doing that, a bit of the skin stuck to the fork. I tasted it out of curiosity, and it was good. It was creamy and buttery, what's not to like? So then, I grabbed a mug and poured myself a drink. AMAZING! It was delicious. This is how milk should taste. I would drink this stuff all the time.</p><p>As of right now, my visa for Thailand expires on August 18<sup>th</sup>. I could do a border run and get a two week extension, but I'm currently looking for other ideas. If anybody wants to meet up somewhere...anywhere...let me know. Right now I'm looking at either Europe or Korea. I'm also open to seeing some new cities in the US. Let me know if you have any free time in the end of August.</p><p>Other than that, things are pretty normal. Except that I stopped wearing underwear. Commando!</p></div>
